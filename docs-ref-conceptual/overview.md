# Azure CLI 2.0

There is a new CLI for Azure: the Azure CLI 2.0, now available as a beta on [GitHub](http://github.com/azure/azure-cli).
Azure CLI 2.0 is applicable when you use the Resource Manager [deployment model](/azure/resource-manager-deployment-model).

Today Azure CLI 2.0 supports these services:
- Container Service
- Network
- Resource Manager
- Storage
- Virtual Machines

These services are available in preview:
- App Service
- Batch
- Containers
- DocumentDB
- IoT Hub
- Key Vault
- Redis
- Role
- SQL

> [!Note]
> If you use both CLIs, remember that `azure` is the old CLI - Azure CLI, and that `az` is the new CLI - Azure CLI 2.0. 

[Get started](get-started-with-az-cli2.md) with Azure CLI 2.0 now.
