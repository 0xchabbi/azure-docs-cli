# Azure CLI 2.0

This is the new version of CLI for Azure -
improved and updated to provide a more native command line experience in bash for managing Azure resources.
Azure CLI 2.0 is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli).
It works with the Resource Manager deployment model and can be used for all management tasks.
If you use the previous version of the CLI (Azure CLI), you can continue to use it.

| General availability | Preview      |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Container Service    | App services |
| Network              | Batch        |
| Resource Manager     | DocumentDB   |
| Storage              | IoT          |
| Virtual Machines     | Key Vault    |
|                      | Redis        |
